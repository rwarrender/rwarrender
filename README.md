### Hi there, I'm Richard ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a seasoned iOS developer, currently crafting an iOS game with a custom engine that utilises CoreAnimation.

ðŸŒ± Excited by the potential of integrating AI, deep learning, and CoreML into iOS development. 

ðŸ‘¯ Let's connect if you're an iOS developer or just curious about it. Find me at a London Meetup!

ðŸ’¬ Got questions about UIKit, Swift, or integrating network layers and REST APIs? I've got answers.

ðŸ“« Catch me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardwarrender/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rcwarrender), or drop me a message on my [blog](https://richardwarrender.com/).

âš¡ Fun fact: I can fly planes and prevent AI from taking all the boring human jobs!

Living in Xcode, Swift and too many shell terminals as I create user-friendly mobile applications. Stay tuned to see what's next!
