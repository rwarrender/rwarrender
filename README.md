### Hi there, I'm Richard ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Excited by the potential of integrating AI, deep learning, and CoreML into iOS development. 

ðŸ‘¯ Let's connect if you're an iOS developer or just curious about it!

ðŸ’¬ Got questions about UIKit, Swift, or integrating network layers and REST APIs? I've got answers.

âš¡ Fun fact: I can fly planes and prevent AI from taking all the boring human jobs!

Living in Swift, Xcode, and SSH terminal as I create user-friendly mobile applications. Stay tuned to see what's next!
